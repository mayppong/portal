There is a cool Elixir exercise that shows how to create "doors", connect them, and send data through them using Elixir. These doors seem really useful as they work with a cluster set up where you can have EVM runing any where and just pass data back and forth. I can see this come in handy when processing a large set of data. You can check it out over at [HowIStart](https://howistart.org/posts/elixir/1).

The code right now is taken pretty much just from the website. Nothing added to it but a few unit tests. I've been trying to learn how to do that in Elixir as well.

At the end of the tutorial though, the author offered a few ideas on how I can take it further so I might need to give that a try when I have time.
